Testing Script:
	* can we pull in boat speed data from Victron system?  over wifi?
	* is optimum at a certain speed, or at a certain brake, or moving target?
	* run final, 'authoritative' tests for all the tests we have working now.  extract the data and see that it all makes sense.
	* write some questions for vesc forums - is this the optimium?  is there a better algorithm to try to match an unknown target?
	* write a post for the SA forums - introduce project, but also ask for criticism on design of water based parts. how to design a prop for this use case - what is best?  big diameter? low/high pitch? variable pitch?  what software to use for prop blades?

Graph Script:

	* update graph script to make these graphs:
		* rpm vs wattage, brake current
		* rpm vs peak efficiency
		* speed (kts) vs rpm (generator)
		* drag (load cell) vs wattage

3D Design:

	* double check line to be used - dyneema?  size?
	* test reverse cat configuration
	* test new duct configuration
	* design duct configuration for smaller motor

Long Term:

	* What happens when battery gets full?
	* Look up Victron style 3 stage charging, can we implement that?
	* Allow to charge / Allow to discharge functionality
	* Victron CAN bus or connect via Cerbo over network?
