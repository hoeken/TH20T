* try swapping out drivers to see if voltage / amperage readings are better

* thot-test.sh
	* is optimum at a certain speed, or at a certain brake, or moving target?
	* figure out how to call victron scripts from main test script

* update graph script to also pull in parameters from the load, and shunt scripts, and use the start/end time from the thot-experiment script
	* possibly also allow to pass in optional start/end params

* update graph script to make these graphs:
	* rpm, wattage, brake current
	* rpm wattage, peak efficiency
	* speed (kts) vs rpm (generator)
	* drag (load cell) vs wattage

3D Design:

* Mast attachment should be a base with a fillet like on a kite foil

Long Term:

* What happens when battery gets full?
* Look up Victron 3 stage charging, can we implement that?
* Allow to charge / Allow to discharge functionality
* Victron CAN bus or connect via Cerbo over network?
