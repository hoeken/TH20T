Testing Script:

* can we pull in boat speed data from Victron system?  over wifi?
* is optimum at a certain speed, or at a certain brake, or moving target?
* run final, 'authoritative' tests for all the tests we have working now.  extract the data and see that it all makes sense.
* generate some questions for vesc forums - is this the optimium?  is there a better algorithm to try to match an unknown target?
* generate a post for the SA forums - introduce project, but also ask for criticism on design of water based parts. how to design a prop for this use case - what is best?  big diameter? low/high pitch? variable pitch?  what software to use for prop blades?

Graph Script:

* update graph script to also pull in parameters from the load, and shunt scripts, and use the start/end time from the thot-experiment script
	* possibly also allow to pass in optional start/end time params

* update graph script to make these graphs:
	* rpm, wattage, brake current
	* rpm wattage, peak efficiency
	* speed (kts) vs rpm (generator)
	* drag (load cell) vs wattage

3D Design:

* double check line to be used - dyneema?  size?
* test reverse cat configuration
* test new duct configuration
* test duct configuration with smaller motor as well

Long Term:

* What happens when battery gets full?
* Look up Victron style 3 stage charging, can we implement that?
* Allow to charge / Allow to discharge functionality
* Victron CAN bus or connect via Cerbo over network?
