* thot-experiment.sh
	* is optimum at a certain speed, or at a certain brake, or moving target?

* update graph script to also pull in parameters from load cell and shunt scripts
* use the start/end time from the thot-experiment script
	* possibly also allow to pass in optional start/end time params

* update graph script to make these graphs:
	* rpm vs wattage, brake current
	* rpm vs peak efficiency
	* speed (kts) vs rpm (generator)
	* drag (load cell) vs wattage

3D Design:

* Mast attachment should be a base with a fillet like on a kite foil

Long Term:

* What happens when battery gets full?
* Look up Victron style 3 stage charging, can we implement that?
* Allow to charge / Allow to discharge functionality
* Victron CAN bus or connect via Cerbo over network?
