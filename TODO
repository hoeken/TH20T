* update pyvesc to pull in config data to get # of poles for rpm conversion
* figure out how to call victron scripts from main test script
* write a script to parse the data and show some nice graphs
	* rpm vs max wattage
	* rpm vs peak efficiency
	* speed (kts) vs rpm (generator)
	* drag (load cell) vs output
* write an MPPT algo to optimize charge
	* set driver to a fixed current (torque?)
	* try to find optimum power generated (scan set_brake_current?)

Long Term:

* What happens when battery gets full?
* Look up Victron 3 stage charging, can we implement that?
* Allow to charge / Allow to discharge functionality
* Victron CAN bus or connect via Cerbo over network?
