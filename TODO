* arduino - get a script running to read the force sensor

* thot-test.sh
	* write an algo to optimize charge
		* is optimum at a certain speed, or at a certain brake, or moving target?
	* add a monitor mode for when we test while motoring
	* figure out how to call victron scripts from main test script
	* add arduino force into logging

* update graph script to make these graphs:
	* rpm vs max wattage
	* rpm vs peak efficiency
	* speed (kts) vs rpm (generator)
	* drag (load cell) vs output


Long Term:

* What happens when battery gets full?
* Look up Victron 3 stage charging, can we implement that?
* Allow to charge / Allow to discharge functionality
* Victron CAN bus or connect via Cerbo over network?
